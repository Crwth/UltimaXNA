UltimaXNA
=========

Personal fork of the UltimaXNA client @ http://code.google.com/p/ultimaxna/

Current plan is to replace all file parsing with OpenUO. So UOP files can be read.
Second step either update or fully replace netcode, to come up to date with latest runuo rev(2.2 svn 890)

End Goal is to convert to silverlight 5. All unsafe code needs to go, with Spilversprite
all rendering components still exist. Sound, and input may need a re write as well
